# ropus

A Rust port of [xiph/opus](https://github.com/xiph/opus) with a bit-exact comparison workflow against the C reference codec.

For library usage and the crates.io quickstart, see [`ropus/README.md`](ropus/README.md) or the crates.io page.

## What this project is

This repository is a Cargo workspace: the published library crate lives in `ropus/`, with a C comparison harness, end-user CLI, and C ABI shim alongside for parity testing and integration.

- `ropus/src/` contains codec modules (`celt`, `silk`, `opus`, `dnn`) and shared types in `types.rs`.
- `ropus-cli/` is the end-user CLI (encode/decode/transcode/play).
- `harness/` builds C Opus as `opus_ref` and runs `ropus-compare`.
- `capi/` exposes the Rust codec through the libopus C ABI.
- `tests/conformance/` is the workspace conformance suite; `tests/vectors/` stores deterministic WAV fixtures.
- `tools/` hosts the coordination script for multi-step implementation workflows.

## Quick setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x4D44/ropus.git
cd ropus

# Fetch external build assets (pinned, idempotent, cached).
#   `reference` clones xiph/opus at a pinned commit.
#   `weights`   downloads the DNN model tarball (~135 MB) and extracts into reference/dnn/.
#   `all`       does both, in order.
cargo run -p fetch-assets -- all

cargo build
```

Required:

- Rust 2024 (`1.85+`)
- C compiler toolchain (MSVC/GCC/Clang)
- `git`, `curl`, `tar` on `PATH` (all three ship with Windows 10 1803+, macOS, and
  every mainstream Linux distro — used by `fetch-assets`)
- `reference/` directory containing the Opus C source tree (produced by
  `cargo run -p fetch-assets -- reference`)

If you run `cargo build` before fetching assets, the harness build script panics
with a clear pointer to the `fetch-assets` command — nothing subtle, but the
explicit fetch step is cleaner than surprise network I/O during `cargo build`.

## Core commands

```bash
cargo build
cargo run --bin ropus-compare -- encode tests/vectors/48k_sine1k_loud.wav
cargo run --bin ropus-compare -- decode tests/vectors/48k_impulse.wav
cargo run --bin ropus-compare -- roundtrip tests/vectors/48k_sine1k_loud.wav --bitrate 64000
cargo run --bin ropus-compare -- unit range_coder
cargo run --bin ropus-compare -- bench tests/vectors/48k_sine1k_loud.wav --iters 10
cargo test
cargo llvm-cov
```

`ropus-compare` also supports:
- `encode`, `decode`, `roundtrip`
- `framecompare`, `decodecompare`, `mathcompare`, `rngtest`, `bench`
- `unit <module>` for module checks

## Testing scope

We validate ropus against several independent oracles. This section documents what is and is not covered today, so the compatibility story is legible at a glance.

### What we test

- **Per-module unit tests.** Each `ropus/src/{celt,silk,opus,dnn}/` module ships Rust unit tests that exercise leaf functions against hand-specified expected values.
- **Differential FFI harness** (`harness/`). Links the C reference as `libopus_ref` and compares encode/decode output byte-for-byte. Drives `ropus-compare encode|decode|roundtrip|framecompare|decodecompare|mathcompare|rngtest`.
- **`cargo-fuzz` campaigns** (`tests/fuzz/`). Long-running differential fuzz with the C reference as oracle; weekly cadence documented in `tests/fuzz/README.md`.
- **Official xiph/opus test suite** (`tests/conformance/`). Reference `test_opus_*.c` programs compile unmodified against our C ABI shim (`capi/`) and pass. Invoke with `cargo test -p conformance -- --test-threads=1` (the reference test harness has module-global state; single-threaded execution is required).
- **IETF RFC 6716 / RFC 8251 bitstream vectors.** The canonical spec-level oracle. The 12 reference bitstreams × {mono, stereo} are driven through `opus_demo -d` + `opus_compare` (both upstream `.c` files compiled verbatim) and asserted to pass the RFC-mandated quality threshold. Fetch once with `tools/fetch_ietf_vectors.sh` (or `.ps1` on Windows) — vectors are ~71 MB and stay out of the repo. Run as part of `cargo test -p conformance --test ietf_vectors -- --test-threads=1`. Status: wired; 22/24 pass; 2 stereo vectors (testvector02, testvector10) tracked as a decoder bug follow-up and currently `#[ignore]`'d — run them with `-- --ignored` once fixed.
- **Ambisonics (`channel_mapping == 3`) roundtrip.** `harness/src/bin/projection_roundtrip.rs` verifies byte-exact encode and sample-exact decode across first-through-fifth-order ambisonic fixtures.

### What we don't test (and why)

- **`test_opus_projection.c`.** End-to-end projection is already validated by the ambisonics roundtrip harness. The reference test additionally pokes the internal `mapping_matrix_*` API, which is not yet exposed through the capi shim. Planned in `wrk_docs/2026.04.19 - HLD - conformance-ietf-projection-regressions.md`.
- **`regression_test()` in `test_opus_encode.c`.** Currently stubbed — the real `opus_encode_regressions.c` calls surround and projection encoders that weren't wired when the conformance suite first went green. Un-stubbing is part of the HLD above.
- **`test_opus_dred.c`.** DRED (Deep REDundancy) is Opus 1.5+, not part of RFC 6716. Requires porting the DRED decoder plus RDOVAE neural inference (~1700 LOC C plus model weights). Deferred; a separate HLD will scope it.
- **`test_opus_custom.c`.** Custom modes (`opus_custom_*`, `#ifdef CUSTOM_MODES`) allow non-standard frame sizes and are not interoperable with RFC 6716 streams. Effectively deprecated upstream and out of scope for a "public Opus" crate.
- **Platform-specific SIMD (NEON, SSE4.1, AVX2 intrinsics).** ropus uses the `wide` crate for portable SIMD. Hand-tuned platform paths are an intentional deferral — see `wrk_journals/` for rationale.
- **QEXT (Opus 2.0 extensions).** Not ported. All QEXT-gated branches of the conformance tests compile out with `ENABLE_QEXT` undefined.

## Performance

Rust / C reference ratio (lower is better) measured via `tools/bench_sweep.sh --iters=30`
on an Opus 1.5.2 C reference baseline, current `master`. Encode ratio is what you pay
to encode; decode ratio is what you pay to decode. <1.0 means Rust is *faster* than
the C reference (which dispatches to hand-tuned SSE4.1/AVX2 at runtime).

| Vector                   | Encode | Decode |
|--------------------------|:------:|:------:|
| SILK NB 8k mono noise    | 1.05×  | 0.69×  |
| SILK WB 16k mono noise   | 1.14×  | 0.89×  |
| Hybrid 24k mono noise    | 1.11×  | 0.90×  |
| CELT FB 48k mono noise   | 1.08×  | 0.92×  |
| CELT FB 48k stereo noise | 1.04×  | 0.94×  |
| CELT 48k sine 1k loud    | 0.94×  | 1.05×  |
| CELT 48k sweep           | 0.96×  | 0.99×  |
| CELT 48k square 1k       | 1.03×  | 1.03×  |
| SPEECH 48k mono (TTS)    | 0.84×  | 0.98×  |
| MUSIC 48k stereo         | 1.01×  | 0.98×  |
| **Mean**                 | **1.02×** | **0.95×** |

Four vectors encode *faster* than C (sine, sweep, SPEECH, with MUSIC at parity).
Decode is uniformly at or faster than the C reference. Full measurement log:
[`wrk_journals/2026.04.19 - JRN - avx2-baseline.md`](wrk_journals/2026.04.19%20-%20JRN%20-%20avx2-baseline.md).

### Non-standard release profile

Two deliberate tunings in the release profile, both empirically justified:

1. **`Cargo.toml` sets `lto = "thin"`**, not the more common `"fat"`. A bake-off
   across all four `{ThinLTO, FatLTO} × {no-PGO, PGO}` cells showed **ThinLTO
   without PGO** is the best mean performer by ~6–8 percentage points of encode
   throughput over FatLTO. PGO is marginal at best and actively harmful in some
   cases (CELT-sweep encode regression of +31pp under ThinLTO). Full data:
   [`wrk_journals/2026.04.19 - JRN - lto-pgo-bakeoff.md`](wrk_journals/2026.04.19%20-%20JRN%20-%20lto-pgo-bakeoff.md).

2. **`.cargo/config.toml` sets `target-cpu = "x86-64-v3"`** (Haswell 2013 /
   Excavator 2015 baseline — AVX2 + FMA3 + BMI1/2). This unblocks LLVM to emit
   modern SIMD from the existing `wide::i32x4` kernels and to vectorize scalar
   hot paths at 256-bit width. The one-line change shifted encode mean from
   1.19× to 1.02× and decode from 0.99× to 0.95× — larger than the combined
   effect of all three stages of indexing work. Full data:
   [`wrk_journals/2026.04.19 - JRN - avx2-baseline.md`](wrk_journals/2026.04.19%20-%20JRN%20-%20avx2-baseline.md).

PGO is still available opt-in via `tools/pgo_build.sh` for one-off measurements,
but is not part of the canonical build. Users on pre-2013 CPUs (Sandy/Ivy Bridge,
pre-Excavator AMD — ~2% of current x86 machines per Steam HW survey) can rebuild
with `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=x86-64-v2"` or `=x86-64`.

### Reproducing the numbers

```bash
cargo build --release --bin ropus-compare
bash tools/bench_sweep.sh --iters=50
```

The sweep runs both the C reference and the Rust port on each vector, reports
per-iter medians, and prints the ratio shown above.

## Development notes

- Keep codec changes parity-first: validate numeric behavior with the harness after each meaningful change.
- `unsafe` is expected mainly in harness/FFI glue; prefer safe implementations in codec modules.
- Commit messages in history are short and imperative (`Fix ...`, `Add ...`, `Enable ...`).
